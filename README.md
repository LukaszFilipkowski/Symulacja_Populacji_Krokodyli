# Symulacja_Populacji_Krokodyli

Project for java lectures, in which the symulation of population of crocodiles is created.  This project is made of 1 interface Habitat and 3 classes that implements Habitat: Wetland, DriedWetland, Emblankment.
Then we have class that creates Population and Test where we check all the project.

Assumptions:
  - On Wetland only females can be born, on Emblankment only males can be born, on DriedWetland both can be born (50%/50%).
  - Every female crocodile can produce 13-14 eggs, when there is a male in the habitat.
  - Every female is able to procreate when she is around 12 years old.
  - Crocodiles may die when they are around 30 years old.
  - Every male is able to reproduce just after being born.
  - If Wetland is overpopulated, surplus of crocodiles are being transferred to DriedWetland.
  - If DriedWetland is overpopulated, surplus of crocodiles are being transferred to Emblankment.
  - If Emblankment is overpopulated, surplus of crocodiles will die.

Whole process of simulation is presented with graf and table.
